Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch.   In this lab, you will create a machine learning pipeline  to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c190178d-53c7-4e8b-b697-efe1fe40adda","metadata":{},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/landing_1.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"27044a8a-bd2f-41b8-a10b-6850c3e53fc5","metadata":{},"source":["Several examples of an unsuccessful landing are shown here:\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"673d67c3-6cbf-4719-9c9e-4dc6dd1099e3","metadata":{},"source":["![](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/api/Images/crash.gif)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f5a41ff3-d0f6-4724-b018-e71d57853d9b","metadata":{},"source":["Most unsuccessful landings are planed.
