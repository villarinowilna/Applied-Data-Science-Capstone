# Space Y Launch Price Prediction Project

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, I took on the role of a data scientist at Space Y, a new rocket company aiming to compete with SpaceX, founded by billionaire industrialist Allon Mask. My primary objective was to determine the price of each rocket launch. To achieve this, I gathered information about SpaceX, created dashboards for my team, and predicted whether SpaceX would reuse the first stage of their rockets using machine learning models and public data.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: I gathered relevant data about SpaceX launches, including launch costs, success rates, and reuse of the first stage.
2. **Data Analysis**: I analyzed the collected data to identify key factors influencing launch prices and first stage reuse.
3. **Machine Learning**: I trained a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage of their rockets.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: I developed interactive dashboards to visualize the data and model predictions for my team.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: My primary programming language for data collection, analysis, and machine learning.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Plotly/Dash**: For creating interactive dashboards.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - I gathered data from public sources about SpaceX launches, including launch dates, costs, success rates, and first stage reuse.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
   - I cleaned the collected data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
   - I prepared the data for analysis and machine learning by selecting relevant features and creating new variables if necessary.

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify trends and patterns.
   - I analyzed factors that influenced launch prices and the likelihood of first stage reuse.

4. **Machine Learning**:
   - I trained a machine learning model to predict whether SpaceX would reuse the first stage of their rockets.
   - I evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics and refined it as needed.

5. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - I developed interactive dashboards using Plotly/Dash to visualize the data and model predictions.
   - I ensured the dashboards were user-friendly and provided valuable insights for my team.

## Outcomes

- **Accurate Launch Price Predictions**: I determined the price of each rocket launch based on historical data and analysis.
- **First Stage Reuse Predictions**: I predicted the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage of their rockets using machine learning models.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: I provided my team with interactive dashboards to visualize data and model predictions, aiding in decision-making.
